(https://res.cloudinary.com/dqm1upnhh/image/upload/v1712917488/backend-movieHub-project_adpyef.jpg)

This is a TypeScript-based backend project built with Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and Prisma. The database is powered by MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes:

Be cautious when changing Node.js versions and remember to delete the .env file if necessary.
If encountering issues with Prisma imports, consider changing the Node.js version, installing all Prisma dependencies (@client), and running npx prisma generate.
